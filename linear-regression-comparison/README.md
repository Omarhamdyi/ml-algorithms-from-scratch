# Linear Regression: Gradient Descent vs Normal Equation vs Scikit-learn Implementation

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates and compares three different approaches to implement **Linear Regression**:
- From scratch using **Gradient Descent**  
- From scratch using the **Normal Equation**  
- Using **Scikit-learn**  

The goal is to understand the trade-offs between each approach in terms of:
- Implementation complexity  
- Computational efficiency  
- Accuracy
